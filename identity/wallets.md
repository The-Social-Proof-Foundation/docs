# Wallets

Wallets are the gateway to MySocial, enabling users to securely manage their identity, assets, and interactions across the ecosystem. A MySocial-compatible wallet provides seamless access to on-chain content, transactions, and platform-specific features, ensuring users retain full ownership of their data and social graph. Unlike traditional social media logins, which rely on centralized databases, MySocial wallets grant users complete control over their credentials and accounts.

MySocial follows the approach defined by the [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard), an open framework for interoperable and user-friendly wallet interactions. This ensures that any wallet adhering to the standard can seamlessly connect with MySocial, enabling cross-platform compatibility without requiring proprietary integrations. Users can store MySo tokens, manage their Platform IDs, and authenticate transactions securely while maintaining full control over their private keys. By adopting this standard, MySocial ensures a consistent and flexible experience for both users and developers.

For developers, MySocial provides APIs and SDKs that integrate wallet functionalities into platforms and applications. This allows users to sign in, verify ownership, and interact with content without friction. Whether posting content, tipping creators, or managing assets, wallets serve as the foundation for seamless engagement. By aligning with the Wallet Standard, MySocial ensures a decentralized, user-owned, and developer-friendly ecosystem where users have full control over their digital presence.
