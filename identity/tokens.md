# Tokens  

Tokens on MySocial can be introduced in a phased approach, ensuring they provide meaningful utility without disrupting the core social experience. Tokens will not launch with the mainnet genesis to enure systems are running smooth. The long-term vision could include both **platform-specific tokens** and **User Tokens**, if done correctly, will be designed to enable various economic and engagement models within the ecosystem.  

## Platform-Specific Tokens  

Each platform on MySocial can have the option to create its own unique token, allowing for customization of platform-specific economies. These tokens can be used for:  

- **Tipping & Rewards** – Users can tip content creators or reward engagement.  
- **Gated Access** – Platforms can create token-gated communities, exclusive content, or premium memberships.  
- **In-Platform Transactions** – Tokens can be used to purchase services, upgrades, or participate in platform-wide incentives.  

This approach allows platforms to remain independent while utilizing a shared blockchain infrastructure, ensuring that tokenized interactions remain portable and secure.  

## User Tokens  

Beyond platform-level tokens, we are also exploring the introduction of **User Tokens**, which allow individuals to establish their own social economies. These tokens provide a unique opportunity for users to invest in the future success and likeness of a creator, strengthening the connection between supporters and influencers.  

User Tokens can be structured in two way depending on the community's tolerance:  

1. **High-Tier Access (Top 5% of Users)**  
- Reserved for the most engaged and reputable users based on social interaction and engagement scores.  
- Designed for users with an established following to create sustainable, trust-based economies.  
- Enables supporters to participate in a creator’s long-term growth and success.  

2. **General Access (User Growth-Based Unlocking)**  
- Users who reach **500 followers** and meet additional engagement requirements can create their own token.  
- Encourages organic community-building before token launch.  
- Allows smaller creators to establish their own ecosystems as they grow.  

## Future Development & Considerations  

The rollout of tokens will be guided by community feedback, ensuring they enhance user experience without introducing unnecessary complexity. Additional considerations include:  

- **Social Score Integration** – Ensuring tokens are tied to genuine engagement rather than artificial inflation.  
- **Economic Stability Measures** – Avoiding volatility by setting clear guidelines for token issuance and use.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Allowing tokens to interact with multiple platforms within MySocial's ecosystem.  

By taking a structured and scalable approach, MySocial can ensure that tokens serve a functional role in enhancing social interactions while maintaining trust and sustainability. These features can be introduced post-Mainnet launch based on ongoing user feedback and network development.
