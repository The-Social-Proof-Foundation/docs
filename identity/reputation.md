# Reputation System

## Overview

The Reputation system helps maintain network security and transaction integrity through transparent on-chain data. This documentation explains how the system works, its technical implementation, and integration options for developers.

## Technical Implementation

### Reputation Metrics

The system tracks specific on-chain activities to identify potentially harmful behaviors:

- Transaction history verification
- Smart contract interactions 
- Wallet activity patterns
- Completed transactions
- Proven cases of fraud or scams

These metrics are limited to objective, verifiable on-chain actions. The system does not monitor, evaluate, or score content opinions, personal views, or non-harmful activities.

### Reputation Score

The system generates a numerical score that serves as an indicator of an address's transaction history. This score:

- Represents on-chain transaction reliability
- Is displayed on user profiles
- Can be queried via API for verification purposes
- Supports security checks during high-value transactions

### Security Mechanisms

The system implements technical safeguards designed to prevent network attacks:

- Cryptographic verification of legitimate activity
- Transaction validation protocols
- Proof-of-operation validations
- Time-based verification requirements

## Integration with Identity Components

The Reputation system interfaces with other technical components:

- **Name Service**: Optional verification status display
- **Social Graphs**: Optional connection verification tools
- **Wallets**: Transaction safety verification
- **zkLogin**: Maintaining security verification across authentication methods

## Appeal Process

The system includes technical mechanisms for addressing false positives:

- Transparent on-chain evidence requirements
- Clear criteria for reputation score correction
- Protocol-governed review process
- Technical remediation paths for compromised accounts

## Technical Roadmap

Planned technical improvements include:

- Additional security verification endpoints
- Community-governed reputation criteria
- API integrations with more platforms
- Enhanced cryptographic verification methods
- Decentralized attestation mechanisms

## Developer Integration

Integrate the Reputation API by:

1. Connecting to the provided endpoints
2. Implementing the verification protocol
3. Adding optional security checks to high-value functions
4. Supporting the standard appeals interface
5. Enabling optional verification displays

The Reputation system is designed solely to protect network integrity - it never evaluates users' opinions, content, or non-harmful activities.
