# Social Graphs

On MySocial, your social graph, including your followers, who you follow, and your connections, belongs to you rather than the platforms. Unlike traditional social networks, where your relationships are locked into a single service, MySocial records these connections on-chain, allowing you to seamlessly carry them across any platform built on the network. Whether youâ€™re switching platforms, trying out a new social experience, or building your own community, your followers and following lists remain intact, ensuring continuity and ownership over your digital relationships.

Beyond portability, on-chain social graphs introduce new opportunities for innovation. Platforms can use open social data to create personalized experiences, recommend meaningful connections, and enable cross-platform engagement without siloing users into closed ecosystems. Additionally, social graphs can be monetized, allowing creators and influencers to derive direct value from their network. Features like token-gated communities, reputation-based interactions, and decentralized trust networks become possible, giving users greater control over their social presence.

Your social graph is an asset you own, not something a company controls. This approach not only enhances user freedom but also fosters a more open and interconnected digital world where relationships are as portable and valuable as the content you create.
