# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested comprehensive expansion of the file-storage documentation to match the depth and structure of other folders like blockchain/social-protocol (which has 11 detailed files). Currently, file-storage only has 2 files:
- overview.md (general MySocial file storage overview) 
- site-hosting.md (site hosting capabilities)

Based on extensive research into Walrus (the actual technology underlying MySocial's file storage), we need to create 10-12 comprehensive files covering all aspects of the decentralized storage system.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Research Findings on Walrus:
1. **Technology**: Walrus is a decentralized storage protocol built on Sui blockchain by Mysten Labs
2. **Innovation**: Uses "Red Stuff" 2D erasure coding algorithm for efficient storage (4.5x replication vs 25x+ for competitors)
3. **Economics**: Dual-token system (WAL for storage, SUI for gas), delegated proof-of-stake consensus
4. **Features**: Supports large binary files (blobs), Walrus Sites for websites, comprehensive APIs
5. **Mainnet**: Launched March 27, 2025 with over 100 storage node operators
6. **Integration**: Deep integration with Sui blockchain and Move programming language

### Current Gap Analysis:
- Existing documentation is very high-level and doesn't reflect the technical sophistication of Walrus
- Missing crucial components like encoding algorithms, tokenomics, staking, governance
- No developer guidance or technical architecture details
- Limited coverage of storage operations, node management, security

### Documentation Constraints:
- Don't mention "Walrus" by name - call it "file storage" 
- Don't mention "Sui" - present as MySocial's own blockchain feature
- Focus on how MySocial will integrate this technology
- Rebrand "Red Stuff" as "Red Hat" encoding

### Phase 2: Economic and Governance Documentation (3 files)  
5. **Create myso-token-economics.md** - MySo token integration, pricing, payments, subsidies
6. **Create staking-governance.md** - Delegated proof-of-stake, epochs, voting, node selection
7. **Create incentives-challenges.md** - Storage challenges, slashing, rewards, security mechanisms

**Success Criteria**: Economic model and governance are clearly explained as MySocial features

### Phase 3: Developer and Operations Documentation (4 files)
8. **Create developer-guide.md** - APIs, SDKs, integration examples, smart contracts
9. **Create node-operations.md** - Running storage nodes, requirements, economics
10. **Update site-hosting.md** - Enhance with technical details for decentralized websites
11. **Create security-reliability.md** - Byzantine fault tolerance, data durability, availability guarantees

**Success Criteria**: Developers and node operators have comprehensive guidance

### Phase 4: Strategic Documentation (2 files)
12. **Create competitive-advantages.md** - MySocial's advantages vs Filecoin, Arweave, etc.
13. **Create roadmap-future.md** - Future developments, ecosystem growth, technical roadmap

**Success Criteria**: Strategic positioning and future vision are documented

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Status**: Phase 1 COMPLETED + File Consolidation COMPLETED
**Last Completed**: Consolidated redundant files and enhanced Red Hat encoding documentation
**Next Step**: Awaiting user approval to proceed to Phase 2 (Economic and Governance Documentation)
**Timeline**: Systematic completion of each phase in order

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**ðŸŽ‰ PHASE 1 + CONSOLIDATION COMPLETED**: Successfully completed comprehensive technical documentation with improved organization:

## Lessons

- Walrus mainnet launched March 27, 2025 - documentation should reflect current live network status
- Red Stuff encoding is the key technical innovation (2D erasure coding vs traditional 1D Reed-Solomon) - rebranded as "Red Hat"
- WAL token (storage) and SUI token (gas) dual-token system is fundamental to understanding economics - adapted as MySo integration
- Mysten Labs (Sui team) developed Walrus, so deep Sui integration is a core feature - presented as MySocial's own development
- Over 100 independent storage node operators currently support the network
- Delegated proof-of-stake with 14-day epochs is the consensus mechanism
- Storage challenges and slashing mechanisms ensure data integrity
- Walrus Sites enable fully decentralized websites, not just file storage
- **File consolidation lesson**: Multiple files covering similar topics should be merged for better user experience and reduced redundancy
