Support subscription models for media: Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus and only provide access via decryption keys to parties that have paid a subscription fee or have paid for content. Walrus provides the storage, encryption, and decryption needs to happen off the system.

Support a fully decentralized web experience: Walrus can host fully decentralized web experiences, including all resources (such as js, css, html, and media). These can not only provide content but also host the UX of dApps to enable applications with fully decentralized front end and back ends on chain. Walrus puts the full "web" into web3.
