# File Storage Architecture

MySocial's file storage architecture represents the first decentralized tiered storage system, delivering enterprise-scale storage through a revolutionary combination of hot storage for instant access, cold storage for long-term archival, advanced encoding, Byzantine fault-tolerant networking, and seamless blockchain integration. The architecture is structured in multiple layers, each optimized for efficiency, reliability, and programmability across both storage tiers.

## Revolutionary Tiered Storage System Overview

The architecture is fundamentally organized around a dual-tier storage model. The hot storage tier provides instant, low-latency access to frequently requested files through high-performance Rust-based nodes. The cold storage tier handles long-term archival and rarely accessed data using advanced erasure coding. Between these tiers, a unified feed system processes all read, write, and storage operations through a single, optimized pipeline.

The system layers include: the application layer providing APIs and SDKs for developers; the unified feed layer that intelligently routes operations between storage tiers; the coordination layer leveraging MySocial's blockchain for metadata, ownership, payments, and governance; the hot storage layer with distributed Rust-based nodes for immediate access; the cold storage layer for long-term archival; and the network layer handling efficient data distribution and recovery across both tiers globally.

## Hot Storage Architecture (Rust-Based)

### High-Performance Node Design

Each hot storage node is built in Rust using high-performance frameworks like `tokio`, `axum`, or `actix-web`. These nodes maintain their own file data rather than sharing buckets, enabling true peer-to-peer file routing and eliminating traditional bottlenecks. Local storage utilizes optimized systems like `sled`, `rocksdb`, or direct filesystem access for maximum performance.

The node architecture includes several critical components: a high-speed storage engine for local data management with RAM and SSD optimization; a network interface for peer-to-peer communication and coordination; a blockchain client for receiving assignments and submitting proofs; a cache management system with configurable TTL and eviction policies; and a background worker for asynchronous operations like cold storage migration and prefetching.

### Hot Storage APIs and Operations

Hot storage nodes expose simple yet powerful APIs:
- `PUT /store` - Upload files with immediate availability
- `GET /file/:id` - Instant retrieval from local cache
- `DELETE /file/:id` - Immediate deletion with cold storage coordination
- `POST /migrate` - Manual tier migration controls
- `GET /stats` - Performance and cache statistics

These APIs are optimized for sub-second response times, with intelligent caching strategies and automatic failover to cold storage when needed.

## Cold Storage Architecture (Walrus-Inspired)

### Long-Term Archival System

The cold storage layer handles archival and rarely accessed data using advanced erasure coding techniques similar to Walrus. Files are asynchronously migrated from hot to cold storage after initial writes, optimizing costs while maintaining accessibility through the unified feed system.

Cold storage nodes implement comprehensive data durability mechanisms including distributed erasure coding, geographic redundancy, and cryptographic integrity verification. The system supports multiple backend options including IPFS integration, Arweave compatibility, and custom erasure-coded blob stores.

## Unified Feed Architecture

### Single Pipeline for All Operations

The unified feed system is MySocial's breakthrough innovation, processing read, write, and storage operations through a single, optimized pipeline. This architecture eliminates the complexity of managing separate systems while providing intelligent routing based on access patterns, file age, user preferences, and economic considerations.

The unified feed includes: request analysis and routing logic; intelligent tier selection algorithms; performance optimization and load balancing; economic optimization for cost-effective storage; and comprehensive monitoring and analytics across both storage tiers.

### Lazy Loading and Intelligent Caching

The system employs sophisticated lazy loading from cold storage, only retrieving archived files when specifically requested. This approach dramatically reduces storage costs and preserves hot layer capacity for high-demand content. When a file is requested from cold storage, it's temporarily cached in the hot tier with configurable TTL policies.

Cache management uses advanced algorithms including LRU (Least Recently Used), FIFO (First In, First Out), and custom popularity-based eviction strategies. The system learns from access patterns to optimize cache placement and prefetching decisions.

## Global Index System

### Comprehensive Metadata Management

A sophisticated global index system supports the entire tiered storage network, enabling dynamic content routing, full-text search, and metadata management across both storage tiers. The index can be implemented using PostgreSQL for structured queries, Elasticsearch for full-text search, or DHT-based systems for fully decentralized operation.

The global index stores comprehensive metadata including:
- Content hashes (CID) and file identifiers
- Storage tier locations and availability status
- Tags, MIME types, and content classifications
- Ownership records and access permissions
- Timestamps and access frequency analytics
- Geographic distribution and node assignments
- Performance metrics and optimization hints

This rich metadata enables efficient content discovery, popularity-based prefetching, intelligent data placement decisions, and dynamic routing optimizations that improve both performance and costs.

## Red Hat Encoding Integration

### Enhanced Multi-Tier Encoding

At the core of both storage tiers is the "Red Hat" encoding algorithm, a two-dimensional erasure coding method that overcomes the limitations of traditional storage. The encoding is optimized differently for each tier: hot storage uses faster encoding parameters for immediate availability, while cold storage employs maximum durability settings for long-term archival.

The intersection symbol recovery mechanism works across both tiers. When nodes fail, the system can reconstruct lost data fragments using intersection symbols from either hot or cold storage, optimizing for the fastest available recovery path. This cross-tier self-healing property means recovery is bandwidth-efficient and becomes even more effective as the network grows.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Optimized Multi-Tier Operations

**Write Operations:**
1. Files arrive at the unified feed system
2. Content is analyzed for optimal tier placement
3. Hot storage provides immediate availability
4. Blockchain registration occurs with tier metadata
5. Asynchronous migration to cold storage begins
6. Global index is updated with tier information
7. Availability certificates are issued for both tiers

**Read Operations:**
1. Request arrives at unified feed
2. Global index lookup determines tier location
3. Hot storage check for immediate availability
4. If cold storage access needed, lazy loading begins
5. File is served while background caching occurs
6. Access patterns are recorded for optimization

**Recovery Operations:**
Recovery spans both tiers with intelligent optimization. The system prioritizes recovery from the fastest available tier, uses Red Hat encoding across tiers for efficiency, and automatically updates tier placement based on recovery patterns.

## Blockchain Integration Layer

Smart contracts are deeply integrated across both storage tiers. The storage registry contract manages metadata and availability certificates for both hot and cold storage. Node management contracts handle registration, staking, and performance across tiers. Payment processing automatically distributes fees based on tier usage, and governance contracts enable decentralized parameter adjustment for both storage layers.

Every file receives comprehensive on-chain metadata including tier placement preferences, access pattern history, migration policies, and cross-tier availability guarantees. The blockchain coordinates economic interactions from dynamic pricing based on tier usage to stake distribution across hot and cold storage operators.

## Security Architecture

The tiered system maintains enterprise-grade security across both storage layers. The system tolerates up to one-third malicious nodes in each tier independently, uses cryptographic verification and redundant encoding across tiers, implements continuous challenge protocols for both hot and cold storage, and maintains asynchronous challenge systems that ensure security even under network partitions.

Cross-tier security includes encrypted migration between tiers, tamper detection across both storage systems, access control coordination between tiers, and comprehensive audit trails for all tier operations.

## Performance Optimization Architecture

Performance optimization spans both tiers with intelligent coordination. Hot storage optimization includes RAM caching, SSD optimization, peer-to-peer routing, and sub-second response targets. Cold storage optimization focuses on batch operations, compression, geographic distribution, and cost-effective long-term storage.

Cross-tier optimization includes predictive prefetching from cold to hot storage, intelligent cache management with popularity-based decisions, automated tier migration based on access patterns, and dynamic load balancing across both storage systems.

## Developer Integration Architecture

### Unified APIs Across Tiers

APIs are designed for seamless interaction with the tiered storage system. Developers use the same APIs regardless of tier placement, with the system handling routing automatically. REST compatibility ensures easy integration, while native blockchain features enable advanced smart contract functionality.

SDKs provide tier-aware functionality including manual tier selection, access pattern optimization, cost management across tiers, and performance monitoring for both storage systems. Smart contracts enable files to become programmable objects with conditional tier migration, access control across tiers, and event triggers for complex workflows.

## Future Architecture Evolution

The roadmap includes multi-chain support for both storage tiers, AI-powered tier optimization and prediction, enhanced privacy features across the system, real-time synchronization improvements, and serverless compute integration with both hot and cold storage. The architecture is designed to evolve while maintaining the principles of user ownership, security, and efficiency across both storage tiers.
