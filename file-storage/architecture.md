# File Storage Architecture

MySocial's file storage architecture provides decentralized storage design by combining advanced encoding algorithms, Byzantine fault-tolerant networking, and seamless blockchain integration. This system is built to handle enterprise-scale storage requirements while maintaining the security, efficiency, and programmability that modern Web3 applications demand.

## System Overview

The MySocial file storage system operates as a multi-layered architecture where data flows through specialized components designed for optimal efficiency and reliability:

### Core Architecture Layers

**Application Layer**: Provides APIs, SDKs, and interfaces for developers and applications to interact with the storage system through familiar protocols.

**Coordination Layer**: MySocial's blockchain handles metadata, ownership, payments, and governance, ensuring all storage operations are cryptographically verifiable and economically incentivized.

**Storage Layer**: A distributed network of storage nodes that maintain encoded data fragments with built-in redundancy and self-healing capabilities.

**Network Layer**: Advanced networking protocols that enable efficient data distribution, recovery, and challenge operations across a global node network.

## Red Hat Encoding Algorithm

At the core of MySocial's storage efficiency lies the Red Hat encoding algorithm - a two-dimensional erasure coding system that improves upon traditional storage approaches.

### Traditional Storage Limitations

Existing decentralized storage systems face a fundamental trade-off:

**Full Replication Systems**: Store complete copies of files on multiple nodes, providing easy access but requiring 25x or more storage overhead for enterprise security levels.

**Simple Erasure Coding**: Uses one-dimensional Reed-Solomon encoding to reduce storage requirements but suffers from expensive recovery operations that require downloading entire files when nodes fail.

### Red Hat 2D Innovation

Red Hat encoding solves these limitations through a sophisticated two-dimensional approach:

#### Primary Dimension Encoding

Files are first split into data blocks arranged in a matrix format. Each column of this matrix is encoded using erasure coding with a higher threshold (2f+1 recovery requirement), creating what we call "primary slivers."

```
Original Matrix: [f+1 rows × 2f+1 columns]
Primary Encoding: Extends to [n rows × 2f+1 columns]
```

#### Secondary Dimension Encoding

Each row of the original matrix is independently encoded with a lower threshold (f+1 recovery requirement), creating "secondary slivers" that enable efficient partial recovery.

```
Original Matrix: [f+1 rows × 2f+1 columns]  
Secondary Encoding: Extends to [f+1 rows × n columns]
```

#### Dual-Threshold Recovery

This two-dimensional structure enables multiple recovery pathways that optimize for different scenarios and requirements. Fast recovery utilizes secondary slivers with an f+1 threshold for rapid data access in normal operating conditions, while robust recovery employs primary slivers with a 2f+1 threshold to maintain Byzantine fault tolerance against malicious actors. The system's efficient healing capability reconstructs lost fragments using only intersection symbols rather than requiring entire file downloads, dramatically reducing bandwidth requirements and recovery time.

### Mathematical Efficiency

Red Hat encoding achieves efficiency improvements that change the economics of decentralized storage. The algorithm maintains storage overhead at only 4.5x compared to 25x or higher for competing systems, representing significant cost efficiency without compromising security guarantees. Recovery bandwidth requirements scale as O(|blob|/n) per node compared to O(|blob|) for traditional systems, creating bandwidth savings that become more pronounced as networks grow larger. Network scaling actually improves recovery efficiency as more nodes join, inverting the traditional scalability challenges that have limited previous decentralized storage solutions.

### Intersection Symbol Recovery

A key aspect of Red Hat encoding is its intersection symbol recovery mechanism. When storage nodes fail, traditional systems require downloading entire files to reconstruct lost fragments. Red Hat's two-dimensional matrix structure enables a different approach: failed nodes can reconstruct their specific data fragments using only the intersection symbols they need, with bandwidth costs proportional to the actual data loss rather than total file size. This creates a self-healing network where recovery becomes more efficient as the network grows larger, addressing the traditional scaling problem that has limited decentralized storage systems.

Red Hat encoding also provides strong security guarantees through its dual-threshold design. The system can tolerate up to f < n/3 Byzantine (malicious) nodes while maintaining both data integrity and availability. Each stored fragment includes cryptographic proofs enabling immediate detection of tampering, and the encoding structure ensures data remains recoverable even when a majority of fragments are corrupted. Combined with zero-knowledge storage challenges and asynchronous verification protocols, Red Hat achieves information-theoretic security equivalent to enterprise-grade systems while operating entirely in a decentralized, trustless environment. This approach enables MySocial's file storage to achieve both the efficiency of centralized storage and the security guarantees required for critical applications.

## Storage Node Architecture

### Node Components

Each storage node in the MySocial network operates several critical components:

**Storage Engine**: Manages local storage of encoded data fragments with cryptographic verification and integrity checking.

**Network Interface**: Handles communication with other nodes for data distribution, recovery operations, and challenge protocols.

**Blockchain Client**: Maintains connection to MySocial's blockchain for receiving storage assignments, submitting proofs, and participating in governance.

**Challenge Responder**: Processes storage challenges by providing cryptographic proofs of data retention without revealing the actual data.

### Node Types and Specialization

**Full Storage Nodes**: Maintain complete storage and challenge capabilities, eligible for all storage rewards and governance participation.

**Read-Optimized Nodes**: Focus on fast data retrieval with enhanced caching and CDN integration for improved user experience.

**Challenge Validators**: Specialized nodes that verify storage challenges and provide additional security validation for the network.

## Blockchain Integration Layer

### Smart Contract Architecture

MySocial's file storage integrates deeply with the blockchain through specialized smart contracts:

**Storage Registry Contract**: Manages blob metadata, ownership records, and availability certificates. Tracks which files are stored where and for how long.

**Node Management Contract**: Handles storage node registration, stake tracking, and performance monitoring. Manages the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

**Payment Processing Contract**: Automates storage fee distribution, subsidy calculations, and reward payments to ensure fair compensation for all participants.

**Governance Contract**: Enables decentralized parameter adjustment, pricing votes, and network upgrades through token-weighted voting.

### Metadata Management

Every stored file receives comprehensive on-chain metadata:

**Blob Identifier**: Unique cryptographic hash derived from file content and encoding parameters, ensuring tamper-proof identification.

**Storage Certificate**: Cryptographic proof that sufficient nodes have committed to storing the file, providing availability guarantees.

**Ownership Records**: Clear chain of custody showing current owner, access permissions, and transfer history.

**Lifecycle Management**: Automated handling of renewals, expirations, and deletion based on smart contract logic.

### Economic Coordination

The blockchain layer coordinates complex economic interactions:

**Dynamic Pricing**: Storage costs are determined through decentralized governance, balancing user affordability with node operator sustainability.

**Stake Distribution**: MySo tokens are automatically distributed to storage nodes based on their performance, stake, and data stored.

**Subsidy Allocation**: Early network growth is supported through automatic subsidy distribution that reduces user costs while maintaining node incentives.

## Data Flow Architecture

### Write Operations Flow

1. **Content Preparation**: Client applications prepare files for storage and calculate required storage duration and redundancy levels.

2. **Blockchain Registration**: Files are registered on-chain with metadata, payment, and storage requirements, creating an immutable record.

3. **Encoding and Distribution**: Files are encoded using Red Hat algorithm and distributed to selected storage nodes based on their stake and capacity.

4. **Availability Certification**: Nodes confirm receipt and storage, creating availability certificates that are published on-chain.

5. **Point of Availability**: The blockchain records when sufficient confirmations are received, guaranteeing future data accessibility.

### Read Operations Flow

1. **Metadata Retrieval**: Clients query the blockchain to discover which nodes store the requested file and verify ownership permissions.

2. **Fragment Collection**: Clients request encoded fragments from storage nodes, collecting the minimum required for reconstruction.

3. **Data Reconstruction**: Using Red Hat decoding, clients reconstruct the original file from collected fragments and verify integrity.

4. **Caching and Distribution**: Reconstructed files can be cached at CDNs or aggregation nodes for improved future access performance.

### Recovery Operations Flow

When storage nodes fail or leave the network:

1. **Detection**: The network automatically detects missing nodes and identifies affected data fragments.

2. **Recovery Coordination**: Smart contracts coordinate recovery by identifying which remaining nodes can provide intersection symbols.

3. **Efficient Reconstruction**: New nodes receive only the specific symbols they need rather than downloading entire files.

4. **Availability Restoration**: Once new nodes confirm fragment storage, availability guarantees are automatically restored.

## Security Architecture
