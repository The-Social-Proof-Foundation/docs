# MyIP: My Information Property

MyIP is MySocial's encrypted data monetization system, enabling users to create, sell, and manage access to valuable information assets through blockchain-based encryption and access controls.

## What MyIP Actually Does

MyIP is not a licensing system, but a comprehensive InfoFi marketplace. Users can create encrypted information assets (text, audio, image, video, articles, data, statistics), set flexible pricing models (one-time purchase or subscription), monetize information directly on-chain, and track/manage purchaser access. Encryption and access control are built in, with Seal encryption for secure data protection, granular access control, time-based subscription management, and owner-controlled access granting.

Pricing models include one-time purchases for permanent access, subscriptions with customizable duration, free access grants for promotion, and dynamic pricing. Metadata fields—tags, categorization, region, data quality, sample size, collection method, and update frequency—help buyers assess value and discover relevant information.

## Key Features

For data creators, MyIP offers instant monetization, access control, revenue tracking, and the ability to update encrypted data while maintaining access rights. For consumers, it provides secure, encrypted access with blockchain-verified rights, flexible purchase options, quality assurance via metadata, and subscription management. Platforms can integrate MyIP with posts and profiles, attach multiple assets, and earn revenue from data transactions.

## Technical Implementation

At the core of MyIP is a set of smart contract-powered objects that serve as encrypted data containers. Each object is equipped with flexible pricing and access controls, allowing creators to define exactly how their information is sold and who can access it. A global registry system tracks ownership and relationships between these objects, ensuring transparency and discoverability across the ecosystem. Secure payment processing is handled through MySo tokens, and a dedicated subscription engine manages time-based access, automatically expiring permissions when needed. All data is protected using Seal-based encryption, which integrates directly with the blockchain to enforce access rights at the protocol level.

## Use Cases

MyIP is designed to support a wide range of real-world applications. Researchers can monetize surveys, studies, and findings by offering them as encrypted assets. Content creators can gate premium articles, tutorials, or educational materials, ensuring only paying users gain access. Businesses and analysts can sell market intelligence and industry insights, while artists and musicians can monetize digital art, music, and media in a secure, controlled way. The platform also supports real-time data streams, allowing for subscription-based access to continuously updating datasets, as well as exclusive information such as private reports or insider knowledge. In every case, MyIP transforms information into a tradeable asset class, enabling a new economy around data value and access rights.
