# Content Moderation

We are committed to fostering a platform that upholds freedom of expression while adhering to legal standards. At launch, our content moderation policy will focus on the following:

- **Legal Compliance:** We will remove any content deemed illegal under United States law. This includes, but is not limited to, content related to child exploitation, incitement to violence, and other unlawful activities.

- **Freedom of Expression:** Beyond enforcing legal requirements, we aim to provide users with the freedom to express their thoughts and ideas without undue restriction. We believe in empowering our community to engage in open and diverse discussions.

## Zero-Knowledge Moderation (zkMOD)

zkMOD's will be implemented post mainnet launch.

As we evolve, we plan to enhance our content moderation capabilities by integrating zero knowledge proof with AI based moderation called **zkMOD**, a system designed to balance privacy and moderation effectiveness.

### The zkMOD Blueprint

zkMOD utilizes **zero-knowledge cryptographic techniques** to analyze content without exposing its underlying data. This ensures that moderation decisions can be made fairly while preserving user privacy. Key components of zkMOD include:

- **Decentralized Analysis:** Content is analyzed in a distributed network, ensuring no single entity has unilateral control over moderation decisions.
- **Privacy-Preserving Computation:** Zero-knowledge proofs enable the system to verify the nature of content without revealing its specifics to any party.
- **Automated Compliance:** zkMOD ensures content aligns with legal and platform standards without direct human intervention.

### zkMOD in MyIP

zkMOD will work in tandem with **MyIP** to enforce moderation rules while maintaining transparency. The system will scan and evaluate MyIP content using a privacy-first approach. 

- **Encrypted Content Evaluation:** All content registered through MyIP is scanned in an encrypted state to determine compliance with platform guidelines.
- **Flagging and Enforcement:** If content is found to violate moderation policies, zkMOD can issue warnings, flag material, or restrict access without exposing the original content.
- **Appeal Mechanism:** Creators will be notified if their content is flagged and given an opportunity to dispute or clarify their case with the proof od creativity protocol.

### Benefits of zkMOD

- **Privacy-Centric Moderation:** Users maintain control over their data, as zkMOD analyzes content without decrypting it.
- **Scalable and Fair:** Decentralized moderation ensures fairer decisions without central oversight.
- **Trust and Transparency:** By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, zkMOD creates a verifiable yet private moderation process, ensuring users trust the system without fearing censorship.

## Conclusion

MySocial is dedicated to creating a platform that respects user expression while maintaining legal and ethical standards. Our initial moderation efforts will focus on removing illegal content as defined by U.S. law. Looking ahead, zkMOD represents our commitment to an innovative, privacy-preserving moderation solution that aligns with the values of decentralization, fairness, and transparency.
