# Proof of Creativity

The MySocial **Proof-of-Creativity (PoC) Protocol** is designed to assess the uniqueness and originality of content registered under **MyIP**. This protocol ensures fair attribution, prevents plagiarism, and helps creators retain control over their work. By analyzing content against a comprehensive set of originality metrics, PoC assigns a **creativity score** and detects potential duplications within the MySocial ecosystem.

The Proof-of-Creativity (PoC) Protocol will be implemented post-mainnet launch.
{% endhint %}

## How It Works

PoC uses a **multi-category scoring system** to determine the uniqueness of newly registered MyIP content. The protocol performs a deep scan of the **entire MySocial database** to compare it against existing content and assign an **originality score** based on the following criteria:

* **Structural Uniqueness:** Analyzes formatting, metadata, and composition.
* **Contextual Novelty:** Determines if the content provides a new or unique perspective.
* **Linguistic/Visual Similarity:** Uses AI models to check for direct matches or near-duplicates.
* **Historical Usage:** Reviews prior appearances of similar content within MySocial.

The final **PoC score** provides an assessment of how unique the content is within MySocial.

## Disputing Content

PoC also enforces **content integrity** through automatic redirection of funds and dispute resolution mechanisms:

* **Perfect Match (Plagiarism Detected):** If the system finds an exact copy of an existing MyIP registration, funds generated by the duplicate content (such as tips and licensing revenue) will be **redirected to the original owner**.
* **Near Match (Potential Duplication):** If content is flagged as being highly similar but not identical, it will receive a **warning label**. The original owner has the **exclusive right to challenge** its validity.
* **Contested MyIP Cases:** If a creator believes their content has been stolen and files a claim:
  * If the accused party does **not** respond within 7 days, ownership is transferred to the **contester**, and funds are redirected.
  * If both parties dispute ownership, the **community votes** to decide the rightful owner.
  * Voters who participate in the trial receive **a portion of the case rewards**, incentivizing fair judgment.

## Community Governance & Dispute Resolution

Disputed cases where both parties disagree are **escalated to a community vote**, ensuring a **decentralized approach** to content rights enforcement. Community members who **engage in arbitration** earn a percentage of the revenue generated during the trial's duration while it is being locked up. This creates an incentive for fair and transparent resolution with incentives for community participation.

### Voting Process:

1. Both parties present their claims and evidence.
2. The MySocial community casts votes on the rightful owner.
3. The decision is **finalized by a majority vote**, either awarding ownership to one party or declaring **neither as the owner**.
4. Participants in the vote share a **portion of the trial rewards**, encouraging fair participation.

## Conclusion

The **Proof-of-Creativity Protocol** establishes a transparent and automated system for assessing originality and preventing content theft. By leveraging PoC scoring, originality verification, and community-driven dispute resolution, MySocial ensures that content **remains in the hands of its rightful creators** while fairly compensating community members for their participation in the arbitration process. This system **fosters creativity, protects intellectual property, and ensures fair revenue distribution** in the MySocial ecosystem.
