# Overview 

Content ownership is a core pillar of MySocial, ensuring that creators have full control over their work, identity, and audience. Unlike traditional social platforms that claim rights over user-generated content, MySocial records ownership on-chain, preventing unauthorized use and ensuring creators receive proper recognition and monetization opportunities. Intellectual property protection, proof of creativity, and fair content moderation all stem from this foundation, making content ownership essential to a more transparent and user-driven social experience.  

With MySocial’s **Proof of Creativity** protocol, original content is not only protected but also rewarded. If someone copies and pastes content without making significant changes, the system can recognize the original creator and automatically redirect monetization to them. This ensures that creativity is properly attributed and prevents low-effort duplication from profiting unfairly. Content remains accessible, portable across platforms, and protected against censorship while still allowing communities to implement their own moderation policies. This approach ensures that creators—not corporations—dictate how their content is used, shared, and monetized across the ecosystem.
