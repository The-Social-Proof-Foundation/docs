# Decentralization

At MySocial, we believe in a future where users own their content, their identity, and their social connections. However, we recognize that achieving true user ownership and governance is only achevable through decentralization. That’s why we are taking a progressive path that ensures the best possible user experience while gradually shifting control to the community over time.

We align with the principles outlined in [this framework on progressive decentralization](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/progressive-decentralization-a-high-level-framework/) and believe that meaningful decentralization should come in stages—starting with a strong product-market fit, followed by protocol growth, and ultimately transitioning governance to the network’s users. Our commitment to this vision is unwavering, and we will continue to prioritize innovation, community involvement, and developer support to make MySocial the leading user-owned social platform.
