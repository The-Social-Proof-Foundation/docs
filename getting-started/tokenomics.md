# Tokenomics

## One Asset, One Community

Unlike many projects that separate token ownership from corporate equity, MySocial ensures that **every token holder has the same stake in the network’s success**. Whether you buy MySo tokens on a decentralized exchange or earn them through staking, you own the same asset as everyone else, with no corporate entity or external equity holders siphoning value away from the community.

This is critical because many blockchain projects are backed by for-profit entities where venture capitalists (VCs) invest directly in the company, not the token. This often leads to conflicts of interest, where equity-holders prioritize profits from their stake in the corporate entity, while token-holders are left behind.

At MySocial, there’s **no corporate entity behind the blockchain**. The value of the network is tied exclusively to the MySo token, ensuring that **every participant — whether an early adopter, community member, or developer — has aligned incentives**.

## Deflationary by Design

The MySo token is deflationary, with a fixed supply of **1 billion tokens**. No additional tokens will ever be minted, ensuring the supply remains constant and scarcity increases over time.

This design encourages long-term value accrual to token-holders and avoids inflationary practices that dilute ownership. By tying rewards and incentives to the existing supply, MySocial fosters a sustainable ecosystem where token-holders benefit as the network grows.

## No Lock-Ups: Freedom for All Token-Holders

At MySocial, we believe in empowering users with complete freedom over their tokens. Unlike many projects that impose lengthy lock-up periods to stabilize the market artificially, we allow token-holders to freely manage their assets. This approach ensures that only those who believe in MySocial’s long-term vision remain invested while giving others the flexibility to exit if they choose. By doing so, we foster a community of engaged and committed participants without coercion.

## Fair Token Distribution

The MySo tokenomics prioritizes community empowerment, contributor incentives, and sustainable development.

### Community (51%)

The majority of the supply is reserved for the community to incentivize participation, onboarding, governance, and ecosystem growth.

\- **Staking Rewards (20%)**: Reward users who stake tokens to secure the network.

\- **Onboarding (0.5%)**: Distribute tokens to new users to lower entry barriers.

\- **DAO Governance (2.5%)**: Enable community-driven proposals and voting.

\- **Ecosystem Grants (10%)**: Support developers building tools and apps on MySocial.

\- **Liquidity Pools (10%)**: Tokens will be allocated to provide liquidity across decentralized exchanges, ensuring stability and seamless trading experiences for all users.

\- **Long-Term Future Rewards (8%)**: Reserved for ongoing incentives and initiatives to support the MySocial community and reward participation over the network’s lifespan.

### The Social Proof Foundation Treasury (24%)

The Social Proof Foundation is the parent research company behind MySocial. The Social Proof Foundation treasury funds are governed by the DAO and used for research, partnerships, and emergency reserves.

The Social Proof Foundation serves as the parent organization driving the research, development, and expansion of MySocial. The treasury, holding 24% of the token supply, is designed to ensure the project’s longevity and adaptability in a rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem.

### Treasury Allocation:

\- **Research & Development**: The Social Proof Foundation will use treasury funds to invest in groundbreaking technologies, upgrade MySocial’s infrastructure, and explore partnerships that benefit the network.

\- **Partnerships**: Strategic collaborations with projects, protocols, and platforms will help expand MySocial’s reach and utility, bringing additional value to the MySo token.

\- **Emergency Reserves**: To safeguard the network against unforeseen challenges, a portion of the treasury will be set aside as a contingency fund. This ensures the stability and resilience of the ecosystem under any circumstances.

\- **DAO Governance**: The foundation treasury is governed by the community. Token-holders, through the MySocial DAO, will have the power to propose and vote on how funds are allocated.

The Social Proof Foundation is a key pillar of MySocial’s vision for a decentralized, community-led future, ensuring that resources are available to build and sustain the network for years to come.

### Pre-sale & Marketing (12.5%)

The pre-sale is an essential phase for kickstarting the MySocial ecosystem and rewarding early adopters. MySocial allocates 12.5% of the total supply to pre-sale and marketing efforts, structured as follows:

\- **Pre-sale Bonus**: Early supporters will receive a **25% bonus** on token purchases.

\- **Liquidity Pool (5%)**: A significant portion of the pre-sale funds will be allocated to the liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. This ensures price stability and a seamless trading experience for token-holders from the moment MySo launches.

\- **Marketing & Partnerships (5%)**: MySocial will leverage pre-sale funds to launch advertising campaigns that attract a broad user base. Build a strong social following throughout all social platforms to enhance global awareness of MySocial’s mission and vision.

By incentivizing early adopters and strategically utilizing pre-sale funds, MySocial ensures a strong foundation for network growth.

### Core Contributors (12.5%)

The success of any decentralized project relies on a committed and talented team. MySocial recognizes this by allocating 12.5% of the MySo token supply to core contributors.

The MySocial team’s dedication to transparency and decentralization ensures that contributors remain accountable to the community while benefiting from the project’s long-term success.

## Aligning Value with the Community

By eliminating conflicts of interest and ensuring that all value accrues directly to the token, **MySocial creates a truly decentralized and community-owned ecosystem**. This approach is inspired by the ethos of Bitcoin and other decentralized projects that launched without a corporate entity controlling their future.

The MySo token is more than just an asset — it represents shared ownership, collaboration, and a commitment to building a fairer future for social media. Together, we’re creating a platform where value belongs to those who make it thrive: the community.
