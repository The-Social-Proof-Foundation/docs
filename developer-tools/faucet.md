# Faucet

The [MySocial Faucet](https://www.mysocial.network/faucet) is a tool that provides developers with test tokens to interact with the MySocial testnet. These tokens allow users to experiment with deploying smart contracts, submitting transactions, and testing various features without spending real assets. The faucet ensures that developers have a frictionless experience while building and refining their applications on the MySocial network.

To access the faucet, developers simply request tokens through the **MySocial CLI or web interface**, ensuring a smooth onboarding process. The faucet is rate-limited to prevent abuse and ensure fair distribution of test tokens to all developers actively working on MySocial integrations. Whether testing **APIs or SDKs**, the faucet is an essential tool for blockchain developers looking to build on MySocial.
