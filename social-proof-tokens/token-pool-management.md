# Token Pool Management

Token Pool Management encompasses the creation, operation, and lifecycle management of Social Proof Token pools. This system provides robust liquidity management, security controls, and operational flexibility while maintaining high performance for social media-scale trading volumes.

## Pool Architecture

### Core Pool Structure
Each token pool maintains essential information including ownership details, MySo reserves, holder balances, and PoC integration settings.

### Pool Types and Characteristics

**Profile Token Pools:**
- **Lower Initial Supply**: Premium pricing with limited token quantities
- **Long-Term Value**: Designed for sustained creator-fan relationships
- **Higher Individual Value**: Each token represents significant community stake
- **Extended Auction Period**: 1-3 day fair launch auctions for broader participation

**Post Token Pools:**
- **Higher Initial Supply**: More collectible with broader accessibility  
- **Viral Momentum**: Captures immediate viral content excitement
- **Collectible Nature**: Focus on memorable moments and viral content
- **Rapid Auction Period**: 1-3 hour fair launch auctions for quick deployment

## Pool Creation Process

### Eligibility and Initiation
1. **Viral Threshold Achievement**: Content reaches required engagement scores
2. **Creator Notification**: Automatic eligibility notification sent to creator
3. **Manual Auction Start**: Creator manually initiates fair launch auction
4. **Community Participation**: Open bidding period with transparent pricing
5. **Pool Deployment**: Successful auction creates active trading pool

### Technical Pool Creation
After a successful auction, the system automatically creates a new token pool with the contributed MySo as initial liquidity and distributes tokens proportionally to all auction participants.

## Liquidity Management

### MySo Reserve Dynamics
**Reserve Accumulation:**
- **Buy Transactions**: MySo added to pool reserves
- **Sell Transactions**: MySo removed from pool reserves
- **Fee Collection**: Trading fees distributed before reserve updates
- **Automatic Balancing**: Pool automatically maintains liquidity ratios

**Reserve Functions:**
The pool automatically manages MySo reserves through buy and sell transactions, maintaining the liquidity needed for continuous trading.

### Supply and Demand Balancing
**Dynamic Supply Management:**
- **Token Minting**: New tokens created on purchase transactions
- **Token Burning**: Tokens destroyed on sell transactions
- **Circulating Supply Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of active tokens
- **Price Curve Adjustment**: Quadratic pricing automatically adjusts to supply changes

**Market Efficiency Features:**
- **Always Available Liquidity**: AMM guarantees trading availability
- **Fair Price Discovery**: Mathematical curves prevent market manipulation
- **Instant Settlement**: No waiting for counterparty orders
- **Scalable Operations**: **Sub-second transaction processing** for high volumes

## Security and Control Systems

### Trading Halt Mechanisms
**Emergency Controls:**
Authorized entities can halt and resume trading for specific token pools when necessary for security or compliance reasons.

**Halt Triggers:**
- **Security Incidents**: Suspected manipulation or attack vectors
- **Technical Issues**: System bugs or unexpected behavior
- **Governance Decisions**: Community-voted trading suspensions
- **Legal Compliance**: Regulatory requirement compliance
- **Platform Emergencies**: Critical platform-wide security issues

### Block List Integration
**Multi-Level Protection:**
- **Platform-Wide Blocks**: Global platform restrictions
- **Creator-Level Blocks**: Token creator blocking specific users
- **Bidirectional Enforcement**: Mutual blocking prevents all interactions
- **Real-Time Verification**: Block status checked at transaction time

Block list status is verified in real-time for all trading interactions, ensuring comprehensive protection.

### Anti-Manipulation Measures
**Hold Limit Enforcement:**
- **5% Maximum Hold**: No single wallet can hold more than 5% of token supply
- **Dynamic Limits**: Limits adjust as total supply changes
- **Purchase Blocking**: Transactions exceeding limits automatically rejected
- **Market Health**: Prevents single-user market manipulation

**Self-Trading Prevention:**
- **Creator Restrictions**: Token creators cannot purchase their own tokens
- **Fair Market**: Ensures all price movements reflect genuine external demand
- **Manipulation Prevention**: Eliminates artificial pumping schemes
- **Market Integrity**: Maintains trust in price discovery mechanisms

## Proof of Creativity Integration

### Revenue Redirection Setup
When PoC analysis determines content is derivative, pools automatically configure revenue redirection to ensure original creators receive fair compensation.

### Revenue Split Implementation
**Automatic Fee Distribution:**
- **Real-Time Splitting**: Trading fees automatically split between creators
- **Transparent Calculation**: Redirection percentages clearly applied
- **Dual Creator Support**: Both original and derivative creators receive revenue
