# Fee Distribution

The Social Proof Token fee distribution system ensures sustainable ecosystem economics while rewarding creators, platforms, and the broader community. This transparent, automated system distributes trading fees to support long-term platform growth and creator incentives.

## Fee Structure Overview

### Total Trading Fee: 1.5%
All Social Proof Token trades (both buy and sell) incur a **1.5% total fee** calculated on the trade value. This fee is automatically collected and distributed according to a predetermined allocation model designed to align stakeholder interests.

### Fee Distribution Breakdown

**Standard Distribution (Non-PoC Content):**
- **Creator**: 1.0% (66.7% of total fees)
- **Platform**: 0.25% (16.7% of total fees)  
- **Treasury**: 0.25% (16.7% of total fees)

**Proof of Creativity Integration:**
When content has PoC revenue redirection active, fees are automatically split between the derivative content creator and the original creator based on the PoC redirection percentage.

## Technical Implementation

### Fee Collection Mechanism
Trading fees are automatically calculated and collected on every transaction, with immediate distribution to the designated recipients according to the predetermined percentages.

### Proof of Creativity Integration
When PoC revenue redirection is active, the creator fee is automatically split between the derivative content creator and the original creator based on the PoC redirection percentage. This ensures original creators receive fair compensation for their work being used as a basis for derivative content.
