# Social Proof Token Integration

The Proof of Creativity system seamlessly integrates with MySocial's Social Proof Tokens, ensuring that token economics reflect content authenticity and original creators receive fair compensation from token trading activities.

## Integration Overview

PoC decisions automatically impact Social Proof Token pools. PoC badges enhance token pool value and market confidence, while revenue redirection applies to all token trading fees and revenue. Token pools immediately reflect PoC status changes, providing market transparency for traders.

## How Token Pools Work

Each token pool contains PoC revenue redirection data that determines how trading fees are distributed between current and original creators. Token pools automatically synchronize with their associated posts, ensuring consistent revenue distribution rules.

## Revenue Distribution in Token Trading

When users trade Social Proof Tokens, 1% creator fees are automatically subject to PoC redirection, splitting payments between original and current creators based on redirection percentages. For every token trade, fees are distributed as follows:
- 1.0% Creator Fee (subject to PoC redirection)
- 0.25% Platform Fee (to platform treasury)
- 0.25% Ecosystem Fee (to ecosystem treasury)

For example, on a 1000 MySo trade with a 60% PoC redirection, the original creator receives 6 MySo and the post owner receives 4 MySo.

## Market Impact of PoC Status

Original content with a PoC badge receives full revenue, market confidence, premium valuation, and reduced risk. Derivative content with revenue redirection shares creator fees, with the redirection percentage visible to all traders. Token prices typically reflect revenue sharing, and all fee distributions are transparent.

## Automatic Synchronization

When PoC analysis completes, the system triggers token pool synchronization, updating PoC data and notifying traders of status changes. If PoC status changes after pool creation, token pools immediately reflect the new status, and trading continues with updated revenue distribution.

## Token Pool Creation

A post must reach 100+ viral points (likes×1 + comments×3 + tips×10) to be eligible for a token pool. The auction process includes a 1-3 hour period for posts, community bidding, and pool creation, with PoC data automatically applied. Disputes can alter PoC status, and token pools update accordingly.

## Economic Examples

- **Original Content:** Alice's art reaches viral threshold, a token pool is created, and she receives the full creator fee from trading.
- **Derivative Content:** Carol's derivative art (60% redirection to Alice) results in trading fees split 60/40 between Alice and Carol.
- **Complex Trading Chain:** Multiple levels of derivative content result in trading fees split among all relevant creators according to PoC rules.

## Market Transparency Features

Token pools provide complete PoC information, including redirection percentages and creator attribution. Traders can preview revenue distribution and track historical earnings.

## Risk and Compliance

Traders should check PoC status, redirection percentages, and creator history before trading. Creators can optimize earnings by producing original content and leveraging PoC badges. Platforms benefit from transparent attribution, legal compliance, and reduced disputes.

## Integration with Dispute System

PoC disputes can affect token trading, with outcomes immediately reflected in revenue distribution. Past fee distributions are not reversed, but future clarity is ensured.

## Ecosystem Benefits

The integration between Proof of Creativity and Social Proof Tokens creates a transparent, fair, and economically efficient system that protects creator rights while enabling vibrant token markets based on authentic content value.
