# Timelines

MySocial ensures platform uniqueness through its **Platform ID** system, assigning a unique identifier to every post on the blockchain. This prevents different social networks from blending into a homogeneous feed, allowing each platform to define its own experience. Posts now have an option to appear only on the platform associated with their Platform ID, ensuring a distinct timeline for each network while allowing platforms to curate their own content.

However, all content remains publicly accessible, meaning platforms can choose to integrate external posts selectively. This allows new networks, for example, to bootstrap their feeds and established platforms to curate high-quality content without diluting ownership or monetization. The result is a flexible, scalable social ecosystem where platforms maintain independence while benefiting from shared, on-chain content.
