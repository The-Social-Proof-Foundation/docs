# AI Agents

We are speculative about AI Agents creating long-term creative value. We see them more as work horses in the background analyzing and interacting in social swaps. Overall, AI agents are inevitable, especially in social networks. Instead of running away from the future, we are embracing it by integrating AI agents on-chain that are limited to social analytics, profile data, tipping, and content swaps. Users are able to opt into AI data monetization where the revenue of leasing out your data is split with you. We are against AI agents or bots making creative content autonomously but of course allow AI tools to help with content creation.
