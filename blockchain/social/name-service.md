# Name Service

MySocialâ€™s **Name Service** allows users to replace their complex wallet addresses with a simple, human-readable username. Instead of dealing with long alphanumeric strings, users can send and receive assets, interact with platforms, and build their on-chain identity using an easy-to-remember name. This enhances accessibility and usability across the MySocial ecosystem, making it easier to connect and engage.
