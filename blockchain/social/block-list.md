# Block List

MySocial's block list protocol is designed to provide robust user safety and content filtering while upholding decentralized principles. Users and platforms can create safe, customized social experiences by leveraging a flexible, privacy-preserving system for blocking and moderation.

## Core Block List Features

At the user level, individuals can maintain personal block lists to prevent unwanted interactions. When a user is blocked, their content is automatically hidden, and they are unable to interact with the blocker's content. Blocking is bidirectional, ensuring mutual privacy and safety, and block lists are private by default to protect user privacy.

Platforms can enforce community standards through platform-level block lists, using smart contracts to automatically apply moderation rules. These tools allow for advanced filtering, management, and the ability to resolve disputes through transparent appeal processes. Global safety features extend protection across the ecosystem, integrating spam prevention, abuse mitigation, and reputation systems to maintain a healthy environment.

## Technical Implementation

The block list system is implemented as an on-chain registry, supporting user-level, platform-level, and global blocks. The following Move struct illustrates the core data model:

```move
public struct BlockListRegistry has key {
    id: UID,
    // User-level block lists
    user_blocks: Table<address, vector<address>>,
    // Platform-level block lists  
    platform_blocks: Table<address, vector<address>>,
    // Global safety blocks
    global_blocks: vector<address>,
    version: u64,
}
```

Blocks can be temporary or permanent, and the system supports granular scopes for user, platform, and global enforcement. Integration points include post and comment filtering, direct message restrictions, mention prevention, and limitations on token trading and access to premium content.

## User Safety and Privacy

The block list protocol empowers users to protect themselves from harassment, unwanted contact, and low-quality content. Users have full control over who can interact with them, and block lists are private unless users choose to disclose them. Platform policies and moderation tools help enforce community standards, while automated systems assist in detecting spam and abusive behavior. All block list data is encrypted and access is minimized to preserve privacy.

Transparency is maintained through public moderation logs for platform-level actions, clear appeal processes, and audit trails. Community governance mechanisms allow token holders to participate in safety policy decisions and dispute resolution, ensuring accountability and adaptability.

## Platform Integration and Developer Tools

Blocks can be enforced across multiple MySocial platforms, with support for platform-specific rules and unified management. Developers have access to APIs for programmatic block list management, custom filtering, and moderation dashboards. Automated enforcement is handled by smart contracts, and the system is designed for flexibility and integration with other platform features.

## Revenue and Ecosystem Protection

The block list protocol also safeguards platform and creator revenue by preventing blocked users from purchasing tokens, sending tips, or accessing premium content. This ensures that bad actors cannot disrupt the economic incentives of the ecosystem, supporting sustainable growth and trust.

## Advanced Features

AI-powered moderation augments the block list system with automated content analysis, behavioral pattern detection, and predictive blocking. Community-driven safety features, such as crowd-sourced moderation and reputation systems, further enhance protection. The protocol integrates with Proof of Creativity, Social Proof Tokens, governance, and cross-chain systems, making block lists a foundational component of MySocial's safety and moderation infrastructure.

MySocial's block list system creates a comprehensive, privacy-preserving safety net for users, platforms, and the broader ecosystem, ensuring that everyone can participate securely in the decentralized social economy.
