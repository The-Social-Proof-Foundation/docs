# Overview

Your identity on MySocial is more than just a username, it's your on-chain presence, fully owned and controlled by you. With MySocial, your profile, connections, and reputation exist independently of any platform, ensuring true ownership and portability. Unlike traditional social networks, where your identity is locked to a single company, MySocial leverages the blockchain to give users full control over their social graph and content. From human-readable names via Name Service to private and seamless authentication with zkLogin, MySocial ensures both security and accessibility.
