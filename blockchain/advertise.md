# Advertise

The MySocial Advertising Platform is a revolutionary ad network built on the MySocial blockchain, designed to create a fair and transparent ecosystem for advertisers, content creators, and viewers. Our platform ensures that all stakeholders are rewarded for their contributions while maintaining integrity through a built-in trust and verification system.

## Key Features

- **Content Creator Monetization:** Creators earn a share of ad revenue when ads are displayed on their content
- **Viewer Incentives:** Users get paid to watch ads, ensuring higher engagement and fair compensation
- **Platform Revenue Model:** The platform earns a small percentage of ad spend, creating a sustainable ecosystem
- **Ad Approval Process:** All advertisements go through a verification process before being published
- **Advertising Platform Score:** A trustworthiness and performance score ensures advertisers can choose the most reliable platforms

## How It Works

### 1. Creating and Approving Ads

Advertisers can create ads through the MySocial Advertising Platform. Before being published, all ads undergo a moderation and approval process to ensure compliance with platform guidelines. This prevents fraudulent or harmful ads from reaching users while maintaining quality content.

### 2. Ad Display and Revenue Distribution

When an approved ad is displayed on an integrated platform:

- **Content creator** receives a percentage of the ad revenue for hosting the ad
- **Platform** earns a share of the revenue for facilitating the ad display
- **Viewer** who watches the ad receives compensation for their engagement

### 3. Ad View Verification

Each integrated platform determines how an ad view is counted and how payouts are unlocked. To prevent abuse, MySocial's system ensures fair engagement tracking by leveraging the **Advertising Platform Score (APS)**.

### 4. Advertising Platform Score (APS)

To maintain a balanced and trustworthy advertising ecosystem, MySocial introduces the **Advertising Platform Score (APS)**. APS is a data-driven reputation system that evaluates platforms based on:

- **Engagement Quality:** Measured by user interactions and retention
- **View Authenticity:** Preventing bots and fraudulent activity
- **Payout Reliability:** Ensuring platforms follow fair distribution practices
- **User Feedback:** Gathering insights from both advertisers and viewers

Advertisers can select platforms with higher APS scores to ensure their ads are shown in high-quality environments, maximizing ROI and minimizing fraudulent engagement.
