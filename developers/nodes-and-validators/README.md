# Nodes and Validators

Welcome to the Nodes and Validators section of the MySocial documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to participate in the MySocial network's infrastructure, whether you're looking to run a full node or become a validator.

- **Full Node**: Operate a full node to help validate blockchain activities, contribute to network security, and support decentralization. Full nodes maintain a complete copy of the blockchain and relay transactions and blocks across the network. [Read the Full Node Guide](./run-a-full-node.md)

- **Validator Node**: Take a more active role in network consensus by running a validator node. Validators participate in transaction validation, block production, and consensus, earning rewards for helping secure the blockchain. [Read the Validator Guide](./run-a-validator.md)

Choose the path that fits your goals and technical resources, and follow the detailed guides to get started. Your participation helps keep MySocial secure, decentralized, and robust.
