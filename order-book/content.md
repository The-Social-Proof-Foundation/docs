# Content

Content on MySocial can be integrated into the **order book exchange**, allowing users to trade posts in a structured, decentralized marketplace. This system is designed to ensure **fair and secure trading mechanics** while preventing manipulative practices such as rug-pulling. Unlike traditional content monetization models, the order book approach provides a **transparent, liquidity-driven** way to engage with high-value content.

## Content Trading

Posts can be tokenized and listed on the **Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)**, enabling users to place bids and asks for content ownership allowing users to be rewarded for foreseeing viral content. The trading mechanics include:

- **Immutable Listings**: Once a post is listed, it remains available for trading without the creator having the ability to manipulate the market.
- **Fair Market Distribution**: To prevent excessive concentration, **no wallet can hold more than 5% of the order book** for a given post (or 2.5% depending on governance decisions).
- **Creator Compensation Model**: The original creator sets a **fixed fee** when listing their post, ensuring fair compensation without direct market manipulation.
- **Non-Participation Rule for Creators**: To prevent rug-pulling, **creators cannot actively trade their own content**, ensuring the order book remains decentralized and trustless.

## Content Trading Rollout

Content Trading can be launched in two ways depending on the community's tolerance:

### **1. High-Tier Access (Top 5% of Engaged Posts)**

- Reserved for the most engaged and reputable content based on social interaction and engagement scores.
- Designed for users with an established following to create sustainable, trust-based economies.
- Enables supporters to participate in a creatorâ€™s long-term growth and success by trading high-value posts.

### **2. General Access (User Growth-Based Unlocking)**

- Posts that reach **a predefined engagement threshold** and meet additional activity requirements can be listed on the order book.
- Encourages organic content growth before enabling post trading.
- Allows smaller creators to gain exposure and establish a trading market for their content as they grow.

By anchoring content within a **transparent, non-exploitable** trading framework, MySocial ensures that **post liquidity remains fair, decentralized, and resistant to manipulation**.
