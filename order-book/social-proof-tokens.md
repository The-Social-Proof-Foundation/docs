# Social Proof Tokens

Social Proof Tokens are at the core of MySocial's economic infrastructure, representing the primary asset class traded through our dedicated AMM system. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Social Proof Tokens directly capture social capital and influence, creating a tangible market for reputation and engagement within the ecosystem.

## Types of Social Proof Tokens

MySocial's token ecosystem consists of two primary categories:

### Platform-Specific Tokens

Each platform on MySocial can create its own unique token, allowing for customized platform economies. These tokens enable:

* **Engagement Incentives** – Reward content creation, curation, and community participation
* **Gated Access** – Create token-gated communities, exclusive content, or premium features
* **Governance Rights** – Allow token holders to participate in platform-specific decision making

Platform tokens are traded exclusively through MySocial's dedicated AMM pools, ensuring continuous liquidity and price discovery.

### User Tokens

User Tokens represent the true innovation in MySocial's ecosystem, allowing individuals to tokenize their personal brand and social capital. These tokens function as:

* **Investment Vehicles** – Supporters can invest in a creator's future potential
* **Access Passes** – Token holders gain privileged access to creator content and interactions
* **Reputation Markers** – Token price helps serve as a market-driven valuation of a user's social influence

User Tokens are traded through dedicated AMM liquidity pools rather than the order book, providing continuous liquidity without relying on limit order matching.

## Social Proof Token Trading

Social Proof Tokens utilize a dedicated AMM (Automated Market Maker) trading mechanism, separate from MySocial's Central Limit Order Book (CLOB). This specialized approach:

* Ensures continuous liquidity through dedicated pools for each Social Proof Token
* Allows efficient swapping without requiring counterparty matching
* Provides lower friction trading suitable for social token dynamics
* Enables liquidity providers to earn fees by supplying assets to specialized pools

## Social Proof Token Rollout

To ensure system stability and proper market development, Social Proof Tokens will be introduced following a phased approach:

### 1. High-Tier Access (Top 5% of Users)

* Reserved for the most engaged and reputable users based on social interaction and engagement scores
* Limited to users with established audiences to create sustainable token economies
* Enables early adopters to establish token value propositions and best practices

### 2. General Access (Growth-Based Unlocking)

* Users who reach **500 followers** and meet additional engagement requirements can create their own token
* Posts that achieve a **predefined engagement threshold** can be tokenized
* Encourages organic community-building before token creation
* Prevents low-quality token proliferation and market dilution

## Integration with Content Markets

Social Proof Tokens directly connect to content monetization, allowing:

* Content creators to earn through token appreciation as their influence grows
* Tokenized posts that can be traded based on their perceived value or viral potential
* Fair compensation models that reward creators while preventing market manipulation
* Non-participation rules for creators in their own token markets to prevent rug-pulling

By placing Social Proof Tokens at the center of the MySocial ecosystem, we create a transparent, market-driven approach to valuing social capital while ensuring fair participation and preventing exploitative practices.
